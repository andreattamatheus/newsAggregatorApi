## Authentication

### Generating a Token

You need to generate a token to authenticate API requests. Use Laravelâ€™s built-in authentication features or a package like Passport to manage tokens.

### Making Authenticated Requests

Include the token in the Authorization header of your requests:

Authorization: Bearer {your_token}
